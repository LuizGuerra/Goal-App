# Goals

This (incompleted) app was a Swift 5 group study, and it's not ready.

### Important

All the app is in the dev branch. To go to master, all bugs should be corrected and the goals screens should be concluded (basically, the first working version of the app).

### To do:

 * Correct bugs;
 * Correct code (inconsistencies and bad practices);
 * Correct the architecture;
 * Finalize all goals screens;
 * Finalize the profile page;
 * Create database for the app and adapt the code for that;
 * Create the forum screens;
 * Create the forum database.
